# Service Bus Explore for Windows Service Bus

Service Bus Explorer code developed by [Paolo Salvatori](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/profile/paolo%20salvatori/)
The Service Bus Explorer is a tool that you can use to manage and test the entities contained in an Azure Service Bus namespace.

Many Microsoft oriented enterprises still are utilizing the ealier version of what have become known as Azure Service Bus product in the cloud. In its original releases the Service Bus on Windows didn't have any UI tools, 
so [Paolo Salvatori](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/profile/paolo%20salvatori/) developed the utility to assist the developers' community. Unfortunately, he didn't make the code available in the github, so the
original code base is hard to find. This project space is dedicated to that purpose.
